The Neural Compute Stick Application Zoo (ncappzoo) is a project created by Intel&reg; engineers to showcase the Intel&reg; Neural Compute Stick 2 and the Intel&reg; Movidius&trade; Neural Compute Stick. The intent is to create a community that can create and share applications and networks that take advantage of these USB accelerators.
